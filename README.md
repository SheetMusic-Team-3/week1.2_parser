1. Download LilyPond (http://lilypond.org/index.html)

2. Copy the output of the semantic model into plain text (you can 
    just paste it into spotlight, a search bar, or enter it the command line to do so)

3. Run the generate_music function with the plain text output

4. Open the generated .ly (LilyPond) file, and compile (command + R)
